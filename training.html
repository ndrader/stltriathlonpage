					<h3>Appendix</h3> 
					<ol>
					<li>RPE stands for rate of perceived exertion on a scale from 1-10. 1 as in very easy, 10 for the effort of a 100 meter sprint. A 5 or 6 generally indicates an easy or moderate aerobic effort or “all day pace”, and 8 or 9 is race pace.</li>
					<li>VO2max is the maximum amount of oxygen your body can intake in the units of ml/kg/min, it is an indicator for fitness, can be only measured in lab settings. World champion athletes have VO2max from 70-93 ml/kg/min, while the average untrained person has VO2max of 20-40 ml/kg/min. Sled dogs can have VO2max from 175 (untrained) to 300 (trained). Workouts consisting of hard 1-6 minute intervals RPE 9-9.5 with equal recovery are targeted to improved VO2 max.  </li>
					<li>Lactate threshold is the intensity of exercise where lactate in your body can accumulate faster than your blood’s ability to remove. High concentration of lactate in your body is acidic, which causes the soreness sensation during exercise that makes you want to stop. Workout intervals consisting of 7-20mins RPE 8 – 9 with shorter recovery are aimed to improve lactate threshold.</li>
					<li>Strides are close to sprint effort runs of RPE 9-10 for a short duration of time: 10-20 seconds. Goal of strides are to improve efficiency through running faster. Since it is short, it also does not create a lot of fatigue. Strides can be completed anytime even if not instructed.</li>
					<li>Brick is a type of workout which you do one immediately after the other. Most common brick is the bike/run brick, in which you run immediately coming off the bike.</li>
					<li>Tempo runs are harder efforts above easy and endurance, it is below the efforts of lactate threshold, but can occasional brush it. It is a run that improves aerobic fitness without creating a lot of fatigue</li>
					<li>Descends in a swim set means you get faster with each interval. 4 x 50m descends would mean your first 50m would be the slowest, and last 50m would be the quickest.</li>
