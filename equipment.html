						<h1>Equipment Guide</h1>
					</header>
					<h3>Introduction</h3> 
					<p>Having the proper equipment to train and compete in the Saint Louis Triathlon is necessary.  Since a triathlon has three different events, you can expect a long list.  Knowing the terrain of the race components is important to ensure you have the proper equipment that will help you train and compete in that environment.</p>
					<p>The swim part of the race is in Creve Coeur Lake.  Being in a lake means you won’t need to fight a strong current and is closely monitored by lifeguards in boats for safety purposes.  The bike portion of the race is mostly on highway 141.  This means the route is paved and it is fairly flat with little elevation.  Road traffic will be diverted during the event for safety.  Finally, the run is around the lake on a paved path which is flat in elevation along the entirety of the route. </p>
					<p>Some equipment is great for training only, but most are for training and race day.  The equipment list can be broken down into three categories; mandatory, strongly recommended, and optional.  Although suggestions are made, the following lists of equipment items are for general informative purposes, you should do your own research to decide on what brand and specific style is best for you.  You can find many of the items at local sporting goods stores in the Saint Louis area, such as; Fleet Feet, Big River Running Company, Swim Bike Run, Academy Sports, Dick’s Sporting Goods, REI, and others.  You can always ask your local sales person for more detailed information and features on specific items.</p>
					
					<h2>Mandatory Equipment</h2> 
					<p>There is a bare minimum amount of equipment required just to be able to participate in the Saint Louis Triathlon.  The same equipment will be used for training also.  For individuals not wanting to invest monetarily more than required and for those on a budget.  Listed here is what you will need so you are not turned away at race day.</p>
					
					<h3>Athletic Shorts</h3> 
					<p>
					Any athletic shorts you have will work. There are many different brands and styles on the market. Some examples include: multi-use triathlon shorts, spandex, compression, and loose running shorts with internal netting.  Ensure it is made of a material that wicks moisture and is comfortable and breathable.  Keep in mind that the swim portion is first so if you don’t plan on changing into a fresh dry pair, the bike portion may be uncomfortable.  
					</p>
					
					<h3>Athletic Top</h3> 
					<p>
					Any top that is comfortable and wicks moisture is sufficient.  Many new materials are available to help protect against some of the sun’s harmful rays.  Since most of the time for training and during the event you will be exposed, this feature is a good reason to invest in an athletic top, especially for those with sensitive skin.  A singlet is a common top that is worn in triathlons as well as tri tops for women which is a top with support that closely resembles a sports bra. 
					</p>
					
					<h3>Swim Top (women)</h3>
					<p>Women are required to have some kind of top throughout the event.  Also, a swimming top is required for the swimming portion.  There are tops available that can be used during all three portions of the race.  Tri tops for women can also transition from swim to bike and run.</p>
					
					<h3>Bike (any)</h3><p>Bicycles can be the costliest equipment on the list, but you don’t need to buy an expensive bike.  Although having a bike with all the bells and whistles is nice, you can use whatever you have to participate.  Keep in mind you will have to transport your bike to Creve Coeur Lake.  You may need a bike rack for transport.</p>
					<h3>Helmet</h3><p>A bike helmet is required for safety.  Find one that allows air to flow around your head to keep cool.  Follow manufacturers recommendations for fit.  You may choose to wear a bandana or headband under your helmet for additional comfort.</p>
					<h3>Running Shoes</h3><p>Any athletic shoe would do, but it is recommended to invest in a running specific style.  Most local running stores such as Fleet Feet and Big River Running Company will provide you with a complimentary fitting to ensure you are getting comfortable shoes that are the best suited for your specific needs.  Always break in new shoes before normal use or training to avoid painful blisters or hotspots and never use a brand-new pair for the day of the race.</p>
					<h3>Sunglasses</h3><p>Sunglasses or safety glasses are required for the bike portion of the race.  The race is hosted in May so there will be plenty of insects in the air.  This requirement is for your safety as well as others.  Riders are in close vicinity of each other and getting a bug stuck in your eye increases the risk of collisions.  </p>
					
					<h2>Strongly Recommended Equipment</h2><p>Some of the items listed here may be used in lieu of the mandatory list if they serve the same purpose.  The strongly recommended equipment is the suggested list for anyone training for and participating in the Saint Louis Triathlon.  The equipment in this list is used for training and during race day.   There are many different brands, types, styles, and price points for the equipment listed.  If your unsure on what specific item to get, do some brand research and/or ask a sales associate at your local sporting goods store.</p>
					<h3>Swim cap</h3><p>A swim cap will keep your hair out of your face and reduces resistance in the water.  There are many different sizes and styles available.  Choose one that fits you well and most importantly is comfortable.</p>
					<h3>Goggles</h3><p>Swimming goggles protect your eyes from water splash and irritants in the lake during the swim portion.  During this event you will be in close proximity to other swimmers.  Having a good pair of goggles will allow you to navigate the swim confidently and reduce your chances of striking another swimmer.  </p>
					<h3>Wetsuit</h3><p>A wetsuit is recommended for the swim because the water temperatures in the water may be below a comfortable level.  The temperature of the lake water in May can range from 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The suit will also help reduce drag and improve buoyancy in the water.</p>
					<h3>Triathlon shorts</h3><p>Tri shorts are made specifically for this type of race.  They are moisture wicking and have some padding like cycling pants do.  They are great for running as well. The shorts dry quickly so they are the all-in-one go-to wardrobe piece you should invest in.</p>
					<h3>Road bike</h3><p>The bike portion is on a paved surface so a road bike is recommended.  There are many different bikes available.  You don’t need to spend more than what your comfortable with spending.  You will do fine with any road style bike that is in good working order.</p>
					<h3>Cycling shoes</h3><p>There are different types of cycling shoes that will work fine.  The triathlon style is recommended because they are attached to the pedals.  They feature quick entry and release, are sockless, and provide good drainage from sweat and water from the swim you just finished.</p>
					<h3>Emergency kit for bike</h3><p>The emergency repair kit for your bike is needed.  You will be taking your bike on long training sessions and a 20-kilometer distance on race day.  The kit should include; tire patches, CO2 inflator if applicable or hand inflator, tire levers, Schrader valve, Allen wrench set, and a tube.  Knowing how to do a quick fix on a bike is crucial and being prepared will help avoid frustration.  Do your research before any long training ride to prevent you from ever becoming stranded and familiarize yourself with troubleshooting any common issues that may arise (i.e.: damaged tire, gear shift problems, or bike chain issues).</p>
					<h3>GPS/heart rate watch (waterproof)</h3><p>Something to help you keep track of distance, pace, and your heart rate is important.  This is a good tool to have for training.  You can accurately keep up with the distance you are traveling and keep track of progress.  It gives you the freedom to explore new routes during training while being informed.  These watches give you real time pace figures and combined with training experience lets you know your progress.  Prior to taking on the challenge of a sprint triathlon you need to be medically cleared to do so.  Having a heart rate feature may help identify potential cardiovascular concerns, so it is important invest in this piece of equipment. </p>
					<h3>Gear bags</h3><p>There will be transition points between the three parts of the race.  You will be able to set up your items prior to the race in order to make your transitions as fast and effortless as possible.  Having a bag set-up for the swim-bike transition and the bike-run transition is crucial.  Any bag will work but bear in mind the more organized, the faster your transitions will be.  It is helpful to have easily identifiable bags and in a position that you are comfortable with that is within the transition area.  If you want to change clothing, then that along with any biking equipment you need would be required in the swim to bike bag.  Same goes for the bike to run bag.  Any nutritional boosts you need will also be located in these bags.</p>
					<h3>Hat/visor</h3><p>A moisture wicking hat or visor is recommended.  This is to help keep the sun and sweat out of your eyes and keep you cool.  </p>
					<h3>Compression Socks</h3><p>Compression socks help with blood flow in your lower extremities.  They will help your legs and ankles from getting tired and achy.  Ensure you get fitted for your proper size, as improper fit can actually be a detriment to your success.  See your local running or sporting goods store for a fitting.</p>
					<h3>Towels</h3><p>A simple but necessary piece of equipment are towels.  During transitions you are going to want to do a quick wipe down to remove water and sweat from your body.  If you’re a salty sweater, your sweat will burn your eyes and be uncomfortable.  It is helpful to have a small towel handy during your event if your other equipment is not sufficient to mitigate the problem.</p>
					<h3>Sun block</h3><p>Having UV protective clothing is not enough to fully protect you from the sun’s harmful rays.  You will need a high quality, waterproof sun screen.  Apply sunscreen and allow to absorb into your skin before entering the water.  Follow the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
					<h3>Body Glide</h3><p>During training you will know if and where you need body glide.  Body glide helps reduce and prevent harmful chaffing in certain areas on your body.  It is an ointment that you apply directly to the affected areas to act as a barrier to any moisture or excessive rubbing.  This can used on feet, groin area, underarm area or anywhere that fabric or material normally rubs against the skin during physical activity.</p>
					
					
					<h2>Optional Equipment</h2><p>This list is optional because although the equipment is helpful it is not necessary for the first-time or novice Saint louis Triathlon competitor.  These are items that are nice to have, although none are absolutely required.</p>
					<h3>Cycling power meter</h3><p>A power meter records the force you apply to the pedals and quantifies a power output.  There are many different types and they can be quite expensive.  It is a helpful way to gauge your progress by assessing your power output with the distance and terrain you are traveling on.</p>
					<h3>Aero frame bike</h3><p>These are the top of the line bikes and can cost as much as $12,000.00.  They are aerodynamically and materialistically engineered for performance.  If you are a strictly time-driven competitor, then this is the bike for you. </p>
					<h3>Aero bottles</h3><p>These water bottles are excellent for the bicycle.  They attach to the handle bars and are aerodynamic to reduce drag.  These bottles feature a straw that allows you to drink while maintaining proper posture and vigilance when cycling.  Aero bottles can be a great way to conserve energy and makes hydration a bit more efficient.</p>
					<h3>Aero bars</h3><p>Theses bars allow you to set you arms in a crutch or “hammock”, they allow you to get into a more aerodynamic position while reducing pressure on your wrists and hands.  Given the terrain and length of the race, these can provide a comfortable ride.</p>
					<h3>Bike trainer</h3><p>Turn your bike into an indoor training stationary bike with a bike trainer.  If the weather is unacceptable for training outside, you can use this to train without leaving the comfort of your own home.  This device attaches to your bike and allows you to adjust the intensity of your pedaling.</p>
